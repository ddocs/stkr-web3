    "faq-title": "FAQ",
    "faq-question-1": "What is Stkr?",
    "faq-answer-1": "<p>Stkr is a decentralized protocol and platform that combines staking and DeFi to remove entry barriers and democratize staking for everyone.</p>",
    "faq-question-2": "Can I stake if I have less than 32 ETH?\n",
    "faq-answer-2": "<p>Yes! To democratize access to Ethereum 2.0 for users who are unable to invest 32 ETH (the fixed amount required by the network), Stkr introduces Micropools – a proprietary solution that enables you to start staking with as little as 0.5 ETH. Simply choose the amount you want to delegate, and the system will automatically assign it to the best providers.\n</p>",
    "faq-question-3": "What are Micropools?",
    "faq-answer-3": "<p>The Micropools mechanism is our unique solution for breaking down the economic barriers for Ethereum 2.0 staking. As the name implies, Micropools allow users to chip in smaller portions of ETH towards a Validator, and receive a proportionate reward based on their contribution.</p>",
    "faq-question-4": "Will my funds become illiquid if I stake them before transactions are enabled on Ethereum 2.0?",
    "faq-answer-4": "<p>No – Stkr effectively tackles the illiquidity issue of Ethereum 2.0 by introducing aETH and other synthetic assets that will enable you to sell your stake at any point in time.</p>",
    "faq-question-5": "I have more than 32 ETH. Can I still stake with Stkr?",
    "faq-answer-5": "<p>Despite that Ethereum 2.0 only enables you to stake multiples of 32 ETH, with Stkr you can stake all your tokens at once, without having to allocate them to multiple nodes. This means you can even stake 1,000 ETH in just one click!</p>",
    "faq-question-6": "Can I run my own Ethereum 2.0 node on Stkr?",
    "faq-answer-6": "<p>Yes! You can become a provider and run your own node to collect staking rewards. If you don’t have any hardware or technical knowledge to set up a node, you can always use Ankr and deploy your Ethereum 2.0 node in one click.</p>",
    "faq-question-7": "What do I need to become a provider on Stkr?",
    "faq-answer-7": "<p>To become a provider in Stkr and earn platform fees, you need to set up an Ethereum 2.0 node with a minimum “insurance” stake of 2 ETH to compensate users in case of slashing events.</p>",
    "faq-question-8": "Can I use my ANKR tokens on Stkr?",
    "faq-answer-8": "<p>The Stkr protocol introduces a new utility for ANKR, the native ERC-20 token of Ankr platform. Providers can stake ANKR token as an insurance fund and increase their reward rate. In addition to that, ETH stakers can stake ANKR tokens to increase their staking rewards from the platform fees!</p>"
