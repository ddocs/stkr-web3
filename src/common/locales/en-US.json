    "answer-1": "<p>Yes! To democratize access to Ethereum 2.0 for users who are unable to invest 32 ETH (the fixed amount required by the network), Ankr staking introduces Micropools – a proprietary solution that enables you to start staking with as little as 0.5 ETH. Simply choose the amount you want to delegate, and the system will automatically assign it to the best providers.</p>",
    "answer-10": "<p>Yes! If you own enough ANKR tokens, you can participate in governance and vote on key parameters to define the future of the platform.</p>",
    "answer-2": "<p>The Micropools mechanism is our unique solution for breaking down the economic barriers for Ethereum 2.0 staking. As the name implies, Micropools allow users to chip in smaller portions of ETH towards a Validator, and receive a proportionate reward based on their contribution.</p>",
    "answer-3": "<p>Ankr's liquid staking protocol allows ETH holders to participate in Ethereum 2.0 staking and earn staking rewards, without running a node and locking your ETH for an unknown period of time.</p>",
    "answer-4": "<p>Ankr effectively tackles the illiquidity issue of Ethereum 2.0 by introducing aETHc which will enable you to trade your stake or utilize it in DeFi protocols to earn yield at any point in time.</p>",
    "answer-5": "<p>Until transactions are enabled on Ethereum 2.0 you can simply trade your <a href={aETHLink}>aETHc</a> for ETH. 1 aETHc should become worth more than 1 ETH over time.</p><p>As soon as Ethereum 2.0 transactions are enabled, you can use your aETHc to redeem your ETH stake plus your staking rewards.</p>",
    "answer-6": "<p><a href={aETHLink}>aETHc</a> is a synthetic derivative asset which represents your ETH stake plus earned staking rewards. When you stake your ETH with Ankr, you can redeem aETHc tokens, which you can choose to keep in self custody, trade or use in DeFi products to earn yield.</p>",
    "answer-7": "<p>Despite that Ethereum 2.0 only enables you to stake multiples of 32 ETH, with Ankr you can stake all your tokens at once, without having to allocate them to multiple nodes. This means you can even stake 1,000 ETH or more in just one click!</p>",
    "answer-8": "<p>Yes! You can become a provider and run your own node to collect staking rewards. If you don’t have any hardware or technical knowledge to set up a node, you can always use Ankr and deploy your Ethereum 2.0 node in one click.</p>",
    "answer-9": "<p>To become a node provider and earn platform fees, you need to set up an Ethereum 2.0 node with a minimum “insurance” stake of 2 ETH to compensate users in case of slashing events.</p>",
